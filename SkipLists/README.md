# Skip Lists implementation

Implementation of a famous data structure skip lists from scratch in C++. Reposistory also includes minimal implementation of BST(Binary search tree) and minimal implementation of Linked List data structures for comparison.

## Coming soon

Soon I will sumarize all the findings in the statistical comparisons folder and put it nicely here to present as a table findings which
will involve

1. Comparison of time for searching the element in BST, Linked List and Skip List(Both random and deterministic), for 100/10/1 million, 100/10/1 thousand and 100, 10 and 1 elements(Last element, middle element, 25th quantile element and 75th quantile element, possibly some other elements as well)

2. Statistical analysis of how many nodes there are in the Skip list built with random building up.
